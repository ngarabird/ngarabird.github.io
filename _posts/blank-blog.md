I have always loved content creation. Maybe it's something inexoriably tied to my personality as a former latchkey kid with free reign of the world wide web from ages 7+. Something about the draw of sharing your world and your skills with millions of other people. The power of reach?

I started off posting videos to YouTube in the 5th grade of myself making origami that (thankfully) nobody watched exept my also-5th-grade-friends who were making parkour videos.
