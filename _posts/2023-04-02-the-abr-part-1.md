This is where I'd write about the ABR Part 1 if I was actually going to sit down and do that. 

The *dreaded* ABR Part 1 Exam
======
Now that I've taken the exam, I have found that it's one of the last things I want to immortalize through repeated Q&A sessions with my fellow grad students. Still... wouldn't it be great if I could immortalize my thoughts on this exam once and for all?

There comes a time in every young medical physicist's life when they learn about the ABR exams. A three-part series of exams- the first of which is designed to test if a physicist is at least one-thirds-fully-capable of making sure patients aren't getting unwarranted radiation carcinogenesis from a CT/LINAC/FDG procedure. For me, this was a moment of shock, since it involved the realization that I would be required to fork over $890 (USD, 2022). Well, fork over that money I did, and now I have another student loan that I never intended on taking. *C'est la vie*.

General Advice
=====
## Materials
* 8.5" x 11" whiteboard
  * I suggest doing all of your practice problems on the whiteboard so you can get a feel for your space limitations during the exam. This might be a little overboard, but I modded one of the magnets that came with my whiteboard to be an eraser by hot glueing some felt to the surface. 
* Ultra fine EXPO markers
  * You might run out of space after writing down 1/16th of an equation if you use the classic chisel-point markers. This is a personal choice, but I like to keep things compact. 
* TI-30XS Multiview Calculator
  * It's either this specific calcuator, or the online version that is built into the exam software. I knew I'd be quicker to the draw with the real deal. 
* Side-view webcam
