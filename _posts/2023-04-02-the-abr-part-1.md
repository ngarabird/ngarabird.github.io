This is where I'd write about the ABR Part 1 if I was actually going to sit down and do that. 

The *dreaded* ABR Part 1 Exam
======
Now that I've taken the exam, I have found that it's one of the last things I want to immortalize through repeated Q&A sessions with my fellow grad students. Still... wouldn't it be great if I could immortalize my thoughts on this exam once and for all?

There comes a time in every young medical physicist's life when they learn about the ABR exams. A three-part series of exams- the first of which is designed to test if a physicist is at least one-thirds-fully-capable of making sure patients aren't getting unwarranted radiation carcinogenesis from a CT/LINAC/FDG procedure. For me, this was a moment of shock, since it involved the realization that I would be required to fork over $890 (USD, 2022). Well, fork over that money I did, and now I have another student loan that I never intended on taking. *C'est la vie*.
