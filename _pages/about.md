This website is currently a massive work in progress.

What am I putting on this website?
======

1. I *might* talk about MRI Physics... at some point...
2. I would love to write blogs about every aspect of medical physics I struggled with. I scoured the internet for information on a lot of weird medical physics things and I want to share everything I've learned.
3. My artwork
4. Graduate school ramblings

See the links at the top of the page to get around!
