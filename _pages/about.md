About Me
------
Hi, I'm Ngara. Welcome to my website!  
I am currently working toward becoming a diagnostic medical physicist, so a lot of what I talk about on here will have to do with that. In my spare time, I like to knit, cook, play the banjo, and learn Spanish.

What am I putting on this website?

This website is currently a massive work in progress. It is a static website hosted on GitHub, meaning it gets updated whenever I decide to type stuff into Visual Studio then push it to the great expanse of the Internet.  
Any views on this website are mine alone and do not reflect the views of my employer. 

See the links at the top of the page to get around!
